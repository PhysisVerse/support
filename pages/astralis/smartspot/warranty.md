# SmartSpot Warranty

## Terms

- Physis holds the sole discretion over the option to repair or replace.
- Replacement products may be refurbished or new at the discretion of Physis.
- Products must be purchased as new from Physis. Warranty only applies to the original purchaser of the product and cannot be transferred. Products purchased as secondhand, used, or from auction sites do not carry any warranty (because we cannot validate if a product has been tampered with by a previous buyer who we have no way of getting in touch with). 
- The warranty duration lasts for 12 months from the date of delivery.
- Products provided as replacements under the service will continue under the original product’s warranty at the original start date. The warranty date will not change or reset due to any service performed.
- Using Physis products with power sources that did not come with the device will void the warranty. All third-party power adapters including Power over Ethernet (PoE) adapters are to be used “at your own risk”.
- Warranty will not be covered for products where the tamper-seal label has been damaged. All product housings must remain unopened in order to be eligible for refund or replacement.
- The warranty does not cover defects or malfunction caused by misuse, abuse, or improper maintenance, failure to follow operating instructions, or use of third-party equipment. Warranty will not apply to damage caused by unauthorised modification, broken security seals or unauthorised repair of the product.

For warranty replacement inquiries please ​submit a customer care ticket and a representative will contact you about a replacement.
