# SmartSpot Warranty

Physis products are built to last.  
Every SmartSpot is crafted with precision, tested with care, and delivered with confidence.  
If something goes wrong, we stand behind it.  

## Warranty Terms

- **Repair or Replace**  
  At our discretion, Physis may repair or replace your device. Replacement products may be new or refurbished to the same exacting standards.

- **Original Purchases Only**  
  Warranty applies exclusively to devices purchased **new** from Physis by the original owner.  
  Products bought secondhand, used, or through auctions are not eligible.

- **12-Month Coverage**  
  Coverage begins on the date of delivery and lasts for **12 months**.  
  Devices replaced under warranty continue on the original timeline.

- **Use With Official Power**  
  Always use the included Physis power supply.  
  Third-party adapters (including PoE) are used at your own risk and will void coverage.

- **Tamper Protection**  
  The SmartSpot housing and seal must remain unopened and intact.  
  Tampering, modification, or unauthorized repair voids warranty eligibility.

- **Proper Care Required**  
  Warranty does not cover misuse, neglect, failure to follow operating guidelines,  
  or damage caused by third-party equipment.
